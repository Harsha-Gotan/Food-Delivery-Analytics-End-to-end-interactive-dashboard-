## Description
This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of food delivery transactions, offering insights into customer preferences, order patterns, and operational performance. Built for business intelligence purposes, it enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by visualizing key metrics across time, food categories, member types, and payment methods.

## Tech Stack
- **Power BI** (for dashboard design & interactivity)
- **Microsoft Excel/CSV** (data storage & preprocessing)
- **DAX** (for calculations & measures)
- **GitHub** (version control & repository hosting)

## Data Source

## Features / Highlights
### Business Problem
The food delivery business needed a unified view of its operations to address issues like:

### Goal of the Dashboard
Create an interactive analytics solution that:
1. Visualizes sales & transaction trends over time.
2. Analyzes product & customer segment performance.
